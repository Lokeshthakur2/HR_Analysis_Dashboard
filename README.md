# ðŸ“Š Presence Insight â€“ HR Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
Welcome to the Presence Insight project â€“ an HR analytics dashboard built using Power BI. This project focuses on employee attendance trends, offering valuable insights into presence, work-from-home (WFH), and sick leave (SL) patterns across a selected timeframe.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This HR analytics project aims to analyze and visualize employee attendance data to help organizations:

Track and monitor employee presence %.

Understand work-from-home (WFH) trends.

Measure sick leave (SL) percentages.

Compare attendance metrics across days of the week and individual employees.

Identify trends over time using interactive charts and filters.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Features
Presence % by Date: A trend line showing how presence rates vary over time.

WFH % by Date: Visualizes work-from-home trends.

SL % by Date: Tracks the percentage of sick leave taken.

Breakdown by Day of Week: Insights into which weekdays have the highest/lowest presence, WFH, and SL rates.

Employee-wise Summary: View individual statistics across key metrics.

Monthly Filter: Interact and drill down into data by selected months.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Power BI: For dashboard development and data visualization.

Excel / CSV (presumed): For raw data source.

DAX / Power Query: Used for data transformation and calculation logic.
